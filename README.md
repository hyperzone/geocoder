# geocoder
A Geocoder custom class for translate GPS Coordinates into an address.

The GeoCoder class present in Google Android API is not compatible with all device. Sometimes when you use this API you can have a Network Exception because the device have deactivated the service, to preserve the battery life.

With this custom class you can use Google Maps service directly, instead of the API.
